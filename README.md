Database migrations help manage changes to the database schema over time. They allow developers to version control schema modifications, ensuring consistency across different environments and making it easier to apply updates without losing data. Migrations are useful because they provide a structured way to evolve the database without manually altering tables, reducing errors and improving maintainability. <br/>

GraphQL differs from REST in CRUD operations by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching. Unlike REST, which relies on multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL uses a single endpoint where queries and mutations can retrieve or modify data efficiently. This makes GraphQL more flexible, especially for complex applications requiring multiple data sources.
